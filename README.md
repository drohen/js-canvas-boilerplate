# Bare bones boilerplate

Hello world!

This branch contains all of the files from the bare bones section of the Canvas Boilerplate tutorial.

There's not much to see here. You'll likely want Node installed. All that's provided is:

- Snowpack
- TypeScript
- ESLint

and assuming you're looking at this on Github, you're going to have access to git.

There's even the assumption that you'll use VSCode (there's a `.vscode/settings.json` file too!).

This branch isn't the "main" branch, so the contents of the `docs` directory won't be visible on the Github Pages domain associated with this repository.
